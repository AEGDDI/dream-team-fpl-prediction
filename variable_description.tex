% Variables specific to single matches
player & player's name \\
season & season \\

goals\_scored & goals scored in the season\\
assists & assists made in a season\\
total\_points & total season fantasy points \\
minutes & number of minutes played in the season \\
goals\_conceded & number of goals conceded in a season \\
creativity & "Creativity assesses player performance in producing goalscoring opportunities for others. It can be used as a guide to identify the players most likely to supply assists. While this analyses frequency of passing and crossing, it also considers pitch location and quality of the final ball". \\
influence & "Influence evaluates the degree to which a player has impacted a single match or throughout the season. It takes into account events and actions that could directly or indirectly affect the outcome of the fixture. At the top level, these are decisive actions like goals and assists. But the Influence score also processes significant defensive actions to analyse the effectiveness of defenders and goalkeepers." \\
threat & "This is a value that examines a player's threat on goal. It gauges the individuals most likely to score goals. While attempts are the key action, the Index looks at pitch location, giving greater weight to actions that are regarded as the best chances to score." \\
ict\_index & combination of influence, threat, and creativity indexes. \\
bonus & "The three best-performing players in each match will be awarded bonus points. Three points will be awarded to the highest-scoring player, two to the second best and one to the third."\\ 
bps & "The BPS utilises a range of statistics supplied by Opta that capture actions on the pitch, to create a performance score for every player."\\ 
clean\_sheets & number of clean sheets in a season \\
red\_cards & number of red cards in a season \\
yellow\_cards & number of yellow cards in a season \\
selected\_by\_percent & percentage of fantasy coaches who select the player in the season (probably by the end of the season) \\
